# What is the correlation between galaxy magnitudes and their redshifts?

::: details Why a website for this?
I was originaly going to submit a PowerPoint, but graphs were a pain to handle.
Word would've worked except editing the graphs were still a pain
Also, Excel was lagging a lot and didn't provide enough graph customizability (on second thought, it probably does, I just have no idea how to use it).
